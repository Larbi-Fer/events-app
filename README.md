## Events Web Application
### Project for 2nd year
    Through this application, users can create courses and educational activities, as well as participate in exciting cultural and sporting events.

    The application database is designed to enable efficient user management. Each user can create a personalized profile with information such as their email address, username and profile picture. Activating accounts through verification codes ensures user security and authenticity.

## Get a ticket for an event
Anyone can get a ticket for any event.
## Comment on events:
